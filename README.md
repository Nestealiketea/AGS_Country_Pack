# AGS Country Pack - by Valerii Safronov

Country Pack is a universal tool for developers that helps easily and efficiently add national symbols to their projects. This package is an excellent addition for creating realistic and detailed game worlds, cinematics, and advertising materials.

A free package that includes various flags, insignias, emblems, roundels, and coats of arms of countries around the world. These materials are pre-configured and ready to use in your projects, making them ideal for creating games, cinematics, advertisements, and other interactive materials.

In addition to the main package, you can purchase reworked textures. These textures are available on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gamenestea), [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/gamenestea) and [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/nestea) pages, where you can explore their quality and usage possibilities in more detail.
